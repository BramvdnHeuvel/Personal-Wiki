    Asilie Race

***Asillie are elven-like creatures that come from the Feywild. Legends say they originate from human tribes that had been banished to the Feywild, where they have learned to adapt to the strange nature of the plane.***

***Asillie look like humans with slightly longer arms and legs, significantly bigger eyes and a slight green-blue skin. They are usually acting with a light mind, rarely showing any negative emotions. Asillie, though rare creatures, often manage to make a lot of friends and draw a lot of positive attention.***

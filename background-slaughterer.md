***Slaughterers were people in service of [the Knight](the-knight.md) who were actively helping [the Knight](the-knight.md)'s undead reign. Most of the time, slaughterers worked in massive factories where they systematically killed new soldiers for [the Knight](the-knight.md)'s army. Some slaughterers, however, were trained to infiltrate in groups of rebellions to betray them at the best occasion.***

***Now that [the Knight](the-knight.md) has been defeated, the slaughterers are the most hated people in the region. Only a few slaughterers haven't been caught by the new authorities and suffered from a death sentence yet. Those slaughterers attempt to hide their past, either by hiding among the people or by trying to run away from their past. Most living slaughterers are filled with regret of their wrongful deeds they have done in the past, and try to live a new life.***

### Feature: Strength of Gut

You have seen such gruesome things getting done to a human body that nothing could disgust you anymore. You are able to bear the sight of the worst injuries without a flinch, you can watch bones getting broken without moving a muscle and you can bear the smell of even the worst rotting flesh.

Additionally, you are able to identify the like-minded who are able to bear these horrible events. With your intuition, you can determine for most commonfolk whether they'd be able to withstand the sight of a humanoid getting brutally murdered.

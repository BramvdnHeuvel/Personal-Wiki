## History

Since The Knight's origin is unknown and their coup on [the Knight's Lands](the-knights-lands.md) was sudden, no living being knows where they came from. The Knight found [the caverns below the Knight's Lands](the-knights-lands.md#the-caverns-below-the-knights-lands) and gained advantage of the undead horde to conquer the whole region of [Korn](the-knights-lands.md). Very little resistance was met by the small groups of dwarves who lived on the surface, and The Knight became supreme king of the region.

## Speculations

The Knight never took off their armour, leaving their identity open to many interpretations.

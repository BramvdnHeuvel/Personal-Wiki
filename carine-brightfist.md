::: ddtitle Carine Brightfist
    The Knight's previous life

Carine Brightfist is a half-god of Taerzun who prepared the region known as [the Knight's Lands](the-knights-lands.md) by building countless dungeons underneath the region. Her life was devoted to building the dungeons and breeding swarms of undead among them, with the intent to one day take over the region known as [the Knight's Lands](the-knights-lands.md). She was slain by [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md), who foresaw the attack on the region and attempted to prevent it.

Carine Brightfist knew that her actinos had gained the attention of several other half-gods, and hence took a suicide mission to battle [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md) and lose, knowing fully well that she would later reincarnate and continue her plan. [Tui](tui-laughingseeker.md), unable to find the dungeons that Carine had been using, left the caves for fables and vague threats, and left the previously known [Bokorn](the-knights-lands.md#the-caverns-below-the-knights-lands) alone. Effectively, [The Knight](the-knight.md) was born 159 years later, who took the [Knight's Lands](the-knights-lands.md) with the army from [the caverns below the Knight's Lands](the-knights-lands.md#the-caverns-below-the-knights-lands).

    Tui

Tui Laughingseeker is a human warlock devoted to and half-god of Y'arokk, who had spread the might and influence of his god by selling secretly cursed items to travelling merchants and tourists who went to visit Shal'qun. He came to an end when he was caught and exiled by [Biz Quio](biz-quio.md), who presented the fall of Tui as an achievement for the [Order of the Twelve Circles](order-of-the-twelve-circles.md) to safeguard the Human Empire.

## Early life

Tui Laughingseeker originated from a noble family known as The Laughingseeker family. The family had a high nobility and significant political influence in the region Arrkia. Here, they devoted their lives to greater gods like Laa and Havscott. 

### The origin of his birth

The Arrkian region started to grow a significant amount of strong paladins like Isa Featherorb, Tizmyl Einmond and Gallo Greenseeker, whose wrath could even turn evil creatures from nearby regions. To prevent the lawful good influence of Laa from reaching too far, the demon god Y'arokk implanted their half-god into [Omale Nauleeme](omale-nauleeme.md), who took her unexpected pregnancy as a regular one.

Despite both of his parents being aasimar, the Laughingseekers did not suspect anything unholy when Tui was born a human and Tui was raised among the family as one of theirs. It was during puberty when Tui learned how to enchant items like the Laughingseekers could and the first unusual signs appeared.

As a sign of devotion to Y'arokk, Tui was given a wooden spin that would gain momentum whenever Tui thought of Y'arokk and his evil doings. This wooden spin sealed Tui's fate to worship the demon god, and his plans to ruin the good influence upon the region of Arrkia.

### The merciless massacre of the Laughingseekers

As an adolescent, Tui thought his time had arrived to exterminate the Laughingseeker family. This was meant as a warning sign to the other nobles in Arrkia not to meddle with desecrated creatures from the territory dominated by Y'arokk.

To do so, Tui Laughingseeker murdered the whole Laughingseeker family in less than 10 days, commencing with The death of Horvald Laughingseeker until The death of Phandre Laughingseeker and her four children. After having performed a bloody massacre that had left experts wondering for the cause of the Laughingseekers' eradication for decades, Tui faked a suicidal act and disappeared into a region to the southwest of Arrkia, now known as West-Yurandai.

## Life in Shal'qun

Tui Laughingseeker has lived the majority of his life in Kalares, formerly known as Shal'qun. Here, he mostly bewitched the region of Arrkia from a distance. His method was to sell magical items as the Laughingseekers would to nobles in Shal'qun, hence gaining the attention of foreign nobility. 

Merchants from outlandish regions would visit his shop to find wondrous items at their disposal, but Tui held a separate set of cursed items around for merchants travelling to Arrkia. To them, Tui would sell the most evil items he had in store, hoping to slowly corrupt Arrkia and expel the influence of Laa upon the region.

### Prophecy

Tui Laughingseeker had received a prophecy from Y'arokk about a half-god would infest a region south to West-Yurandai with thousands of undead creatures, after which the half-god would then continue to conquer all of Yurandai. The takeover of undead upon West-Yurandai could meddle with Tui's plans to corrupt Arrkia.

This is why in the winter of 15064 B.E, Tui traveled to the region then known as Paeloci. Tui had recognized the lich [Carine Brightfist](carine-brightfist.md) as a half-god, and successfully eliminating them. Tui did not realize that Carine had prepared for her death by incubating countless dungeons below Paeloci, and returned to Kalares to continue his work.

## Tui's captivity

When the Human Empire formed its structure, Tui Laughingseeker was having more difficulty keeping his reputation hidden. Previously, whenever a merchant from Arrkia used to blame him and his works, Tui would disappear, open a new shop elsewhere in Kalares, and people would forget about the previous magic item shop as the population died and new people were born. During the Human Empire, however, the humans kept track of all complaints and crimes that had been committed in each city, and hence the guards started to notice a pattern throughout the centuries of a wondrous shop selling cursed items in Kalares.

For 15 centuries, Tui still managed to go unnoticed by the authorities, but the rumours had spread throughout the Human Empire, eventually drawing the attention of [Biz Quio](biz-quio.md) in the 16th century A.E. She went on a hunt for Tui Laughingseeker and eventually found his shop in 1564. After she had revealed her identity of the half-god of Al'air, Tui attempted to flee but was captured by [Biz Quio](biz-quio.md) with the mighty Imprisonment spell. Tui's essence was captured in a jade trinket, shaped like the symbol of Y'arokk with a relief of a maze on all sides of the symbol.

## Current Life

Tui Laughingseeker is currently trapped in a demiplane, shaped in the form of an eternal Hedged Maze. There is no exit, the maze is shaped in the form of the symbol of Y'arokk and Tui Laughingseeker will remain in there for all eternity or unless the magic on the jade trinket is dispelled by [Biz Quio](biz-quio.md) or by a mage of similar might.

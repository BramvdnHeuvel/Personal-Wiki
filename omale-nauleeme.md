    The last Nauleeme

## Life

Omale was a studious girl who learned the art of magic quite soon. Her family was one of lesser nobility, but when her magical abilities proved her worth, she was soon taken as a personal student by Horvald Laughingseeker, who made her a novice apprentice of his. He taught her to worship Laa and to master her inner mystic for the good of Arrkia.

At the age of 17, she went into a romantic relationship with Eikraival Laughingseeker, Horvald's nephew, and they married one year after. It was also soon after that Omale gave birth to [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md). She did not realize that this child was not truly hers, but a half-god implanted into her by the evil god Y'arokk.

During the second half of her life, Omale devoted her life to worshipping Laa, blessing paladins like Tizmyl Einmond and Isa Featherorb on their journey to purify the outer regions. She rarely traveled away from home, yet the Laughingseeker's blessing was very popular among Arrkian paladins.

Omale was killed when she was 40 years old by [her son [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md). She was struck by lightning, which the people of Arrkian had originally considered a sign of impurity. This belief was understated by Gwenras Brynadin, who concluded that the lightning strike had been caused by an immortal being, but the claim was later debunked by [Biz Quio](biz-quio.md), who found several ancient notes from [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md)'s diary where he explains in vivid detail how he had planned the death of Omale.

## The Nauleeme controversy

Before the population of Arrkia discovered the true reason behind the disappearance of the Laughingseeker family, the blame was originally put on Omale Nauleeme. People believed she was too "impure" for the family after she died from a lightning strike. Her strong magical abilities reassured the rumour that she would've been an evil witch that had doomed the Laughingseeker family.

When the truth was discovered a few decades later that [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md), Omale's only child, was the murderer of the Laughingseeker family, this belief was strengthened even more. The Nauleeme reputation was destroyed, and the Nauleeme family was forced into exile. All remaining members of the Nauleeme family fled Arrkia, were burnt alive or married to commonfolk and changed their name.

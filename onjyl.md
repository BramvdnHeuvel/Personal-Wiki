## Followers' traits

**Free the body, free the mind.** No-one should be held captive or should have their lives depend on anyone else's. Slaves must be freed, and everyone must have the freedom to chase their goals.

**Kindness above all.** A true mind respects the choices of a free mind. All good decisions go together with kindness and respect for others.

**All choose their own fate.** Everyone is responsible for their own actions, both good and bad. If one freely makes a decision, they deserve to bear the consequences - both the rewards and punishments.

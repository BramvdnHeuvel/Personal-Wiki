    Knight's Lands
    Korn

**The Knight's Lands** is a region that is mostly known for [The Knight](the-knight.md)'s reign that lasted for centuries and nearly eradicated the entire population. Although previously known as a [dwarven](race-dwarf.md) region called Korn, this region is now mostly inhabited by humans who moved here after [The Knight](the-knight.md) was defeated in the Great Battle for [The Knight](the-knight.md)'s Lands.

## History

Until recently, the Knight)'s Lands is the region that was reigned by a mighty warrior called [The Knight](the-knight.md). [The Knight](the-knight.md) was defeated two years ago by the Human Empire from the north. Since then, the region is slowly becoming more popular and is gaining more attraction by neighbouring regions as the undead are getting expelled from the region.

### Before The Knight

This region was previously known as Korn by humans, and was mostly inhabited by dwarves. These dwarves mostly lived in caves and dungeons underneath the surface, but some of them kept guard on the surface. The caverns, [dwarf](race-dwarf.md)-built caves and dungeons were called **[Bokorn](the-knights-lands.md#the-caverns-below-the-knights-lands)** by the dwarves. The caverns of [Bokorn](the-knights-lands.md#the-caverns-below-the-knights-lands) were deserted when the dragon Ythurth made a lair and laid a nest in the caverns of [Bokorn](the-knights-lands.md#the-caverns-below-the-knights-lands).

These caves were later rediscovered by [Carine Brightfist](carine-brightfist.md) with the help of a few dwarves who still dared to enter an old dragon's lair. She cleaned up the place, and turned the dungeons into a big brooding place for undead, where she'd systematically breed humanoid slaves and kill them for her undead armies. [Carine Brightfist](carine-brightfist.md) did not manage to do anything with this hidden army of undead, however, as [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md) managed to kill her before she did.

The army of undead was later found underneath the surface by [The Knight](the-knight.md), who used the army to their advantage - and quickly, before anyone had noticed, the whole region was taken over by [The Knight](the-knight.md) with its army.

## During the Knight's reign

The Knight's tactic was much less subtle than Carine's - instead of secretly breeding people underground, [The Knight](the-knight.md) would hold a yearly Reaping, where every town was expected to deliver a certain amount of people to the army. [The Knight](the-knight.md) usually wasn't very picky on the soldiers' age, but hence also demanded very many soldiers. These soldiers were systematically slaughtered and turned undead to join [The Knight](the-knight.md)'s undead army.

## Locations

The region hosts various places consisting of small towns. The towns are mostly recovering from the centuries of genocide, but migration from the north has brought new life to some of these small towns.

### The caverns below the Knight's Lands

The region underneath the Knight's Lands is very unknown, for few know of the entrances and even fewer dare to enter them. Originally, the caverns were known as Bokorn, the underground society that lived below Korn before it was destroyed.

The underground system has been a dragon's nest and was later turned into a breeding plant for humanoids, and both can still be seen in the dungeons. The remnants of Bokorn are dark, gooey dungeons filled with undead creatures, treasury and monsters who feed on the corpses that couldn't find their way out of the cave.

Small tribes of strange humanoid hybrid creatures live in the deep dungeons as well - these are humanoids who haven't ever seen the light of day, but whose ancestors centuries ago escaped out of [Carine Brightfist](carine-brightfist.md)'s breeding plant and fled into the deeper caves where even Carine wouldn't go. They're called seminoids and they feed on the monsters that eat the undead, which in their turn feed on old and weak seminoids who cannot outrun the undead.

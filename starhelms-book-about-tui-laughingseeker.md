## Background information

A few years before the publication of the book, [Biz Quio](biz-quio.md) announced to have caught [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md). Since this human was only known from millenia old legends, this was quite a bold claim. Mysteriously, [Biz](biz-quio.md)' organisation was acknowledged as an official organisation by the queen of the Human Empire one week later, which raised a lot of doubt in the population of West-Yurandai.



## Book's contents

_The following texts are the original contents of the book._

---

This story is about [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md), the dark wizard who defeated the lich [Carine Brightfist](carine-brightfist.md) with lies and deceit, but then chose to take a path to darker arts that would someday destroy his entire family.

About 22’000 years before the Human Empire started counting their age, a boy was born in the northern region of Arrkia among a nobly human family called the Laughingseekers.

During that time, Arrkia was still densely populated by a folk of aasimar, which was extraordinary, even back then. The aasimar here were descendants of the humans who were turned into aasimar when the powerful wizard Barnas Brylledan had used a mighty spell to alter reality. He had tried to turn each creature to the good and to guarantee a place in the Higher Planes for all, but failed in his attempt and bestowed the Higher Planes on the people in Arrkia, turning them into aasimar.

Among these aasimar, the name Laughingseeker was a respected name as a family of nobility, and they were most known for their artworks, which they sold for high prices to the best bidder. Their artworks were often filled with magical properties. I will describe a few examples.

The most famous of all was Laughingseeker’s mirror, a mirror with the wondrous property that the mirror image of all would not follow the one, but acted the way one would feel. This would later on be abused by [Tui](tui-laughingseeker.md) as a terrible weapon.

Another well-known object was the pot of wonders, a small ceramic pot with beautiful illustrations on the sides of the pot. If people spit in the pot before going to sleep, then they could gaze back at their dreams by looking at the illustrations on the pot.

The piece of art that was [Tui](tui-laughingseeker.md)’s favourite, however, was a small wooden spin that would never stop spinning. This spin is said to have been found, although many believe that the object was lost in the fifth layer of the Abyss. If the object that lies in Kalares’ museum is the real one, then the spin was one of great destruction - a property unworthy of the respected name Laughingseeker.

After all, the family was one of the great and noble families, for whom honour originated by many for their compassion, righteousness en humble approach. Despite not having chosen one god and family members were separated among the gods [Taël](tael.md), Havscott and [Onjyl](onjyl.md), the family was considered as one of the few families that could not be touched by the evil gods.

Fate turned out to be filled with irony. [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md) grew up as a studious boy with lots of interest in the family’s magic. Much of the Laughingseekers’ magic was remained a secret among the family and was only shared within the family by spoken word - this is why the eradication of the family has lead to a huge loss of magical knowledge.

Something went wrong with [Tui](tui-laughingseeker.md) during his teenage years. There are many theories about how [Tui](tui-laughingseeker.md) could’ve become so corrupt as he were, but I have never met anyone in my life that had any proof for their theory, or from whom the story was consistent enough to consider it the truth.

Regardless of what caused it, [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md) became more and more sadistic during his teenage years. The common story is the one where a beggar asked for a handout, and [Tui](tui-laughingseeker.md) answered with, “like a dog acting disgrace, you shall become my messenger with the Underworld”, after which he beat the woman to death.

A family like the Laughingseekers would not tolerate such behaviour, so when the family threatened to banish him, he struck and made himself the last heir of the Laughingseekers.

There are several horrible stories about how he made his family members die in slow manners, but the most known is the one where he tied his aunt up and forced her to choose between her son and her three daughters. Many gossips are still alive about whom the aunt chose, but in the end, [Tui](tui-laughingseeker.md) disassembled the four children over the course of two nights, forcing his aunt to watch the painful process of her children’s life force slowly leaving their body.

After Laughingseeker had eradicated his whole family with his own hands, he left the region and went to the southern regions we now know as the Human Empire. He arriverd in Kalares, which was known back then as Shal’qun, because the city had once been founded by Sul "Shal'qa" Outlandish, one of the most intelligent orcs that has set foot on this world. Here, [Tui](tui-laughingseeker.md) started selling several items that were often magical and beneficial for the user. His positive reputation also attracted tourists and travelers, however, to which he would secretly infuse cursed items that would bring a lot of havoc into the world. Many of these cursed objects have been dispelled and consecrated since then, but a few are still believed to be lost somewhere on the Material Plane.

Tui’s life went on for a while, but several sources suggest that he didn’t die. I’ve looked through multiple registers from several libraries, and throughout the ages, there have been dozens of reports about merchants in Shal’qun with matching descriptions who all sold cursed items to travelers. My guess is that these stories are all about [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md), since enchanting and cursing wondrous items was a speciality from his family, and because [Tui](tui-laughingseeker.md) wouldn’t have been the type of person to trust somebody else with this magic.

Many of the cursed items were linked to demons. Many of the objects were even so dark, that many believed [Tui](tui-laughingseeker.md) had made a pact with the god Y'arokk himself to summon demons to this world.

Tui lived his life for about two millenia like this, but potentially the most interesting story is how [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md) came to his end. A bit more than a century ago, a school has been founded called the [Order of the Twelve Circles](order-of-the-twelve-circles.md). This school was founded with the idea to educate and train wizards, but when the founder of the school, [Florentinus Monsterreaper](florentinus-monsterreaper.md), died, the school was changed to an organisation for powerful wizards by [Florentinus](florentinus-monsterreaper.md)’ successor, [Biz Quio](biz-quio.md), who is to this day the leader of the Order.

Biz Quio also was the wizard who claims to have found and defeated [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md) It was no coincidence that the Order of the Twelve Circle became acknowledged by the Human Empire as an official organisation one week after the execution of [Tui](tui-laughingseeker.md). [Biz](biz-quio.md) recognized the cursed items as objects of powerful magic, en found their source in Kalares, the rebuilt Shal’qun. Here, she found [Tui](tui-laughingseeker.md)’s residence, which was filled with eldritch objects, dead flesh from creatures unknown to most men, and lots of scribbles and notes that were meant to form an eternal diary. The notes stated how [Tui](tui-laughingseeker.md) wanted to make the world as corrupt as he was. Unfortunately, these notes cannot be looked into, as the [Order of the Twelve Circles](order-of-the-twelve-circles.md) has instructed to burn these notes in a holy ritual.

Tui Laughingseeker has died while [Biz](biz-quio.md) was in pursuit after him. She would’ve cast several spells at him until one of the spells finally bested him. Since then, no living soul has ever heard anything from [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md) anymore.

Stories are told that [Tui](tui-laughingseeker.md) has spent several centuries looking for a powerful weapon that would end the regime of [the Knight](the-knight.md) in the southern regions. We do not know what this powerful weapon would be, but from what we can make based on what the [Order of the Twelve Circles](order-of-the-twelve-circles.md) is willing to tell about the notes, it would be a weapon with which countless of demons would be sent into the Human Empire, that would cause so mcuh destruction in the regions that [Tui](tui-laughingseeker.md) could easily take over both the Human Empire and [the knight](the-knight.md)’s lands.

I do not know whether he already had the weapon under his possession or that he was still busy on acquiring the weapon, but the [Order of the Twelve Circles](order-of-the-twelve-circles.md) currently doesn’t seem to take any actions against [the knight](the-knight.md)’s regime in the south. For now, we shouldn’t expect any demons that would roam the Human Empire by the hand of [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md).

## Reception

The book was mostly received positively by the public. The book tells a story that the inhabitants of Kalares happily share with travelers to warn them for them for [Tui Laughingseeker](tui-laughingseeker.md)'s inheritors who supposedly lived in Kalares for millenia.

Several historians from Kalares' library disagreed with the story behind Barnas Brylledan and the origins of the aasimar in Arrkia. The librarian Bernelle Paleaxe, for example, argued that the story "made claims that were unsufficiently grounded and were based on fantasy stories that have not been confirmed to be more than bardic banter".

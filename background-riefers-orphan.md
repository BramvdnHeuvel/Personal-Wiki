    Riefer's orphans

***Riefer's orphans were orphans who were taken away the the Riefer during the oppression of [the Knight](the-knight.md). They were kept safe and hidden in the legendary Riefer's town somewhere in the woods in the east of [the knight's lands](the-knights-lands.md). Stolen orphans from [the knight's lands](the-knights-lands.md) were taught by the Riefer himself to become great fighters against the hordes of undead.***

***Now that [the Knight](the-knight.md) has been slain and the Riefer has gone missing, most Riefer's orphans roam around the world, looking for a purpose in life. Most Riefer's orphans stay in [the knight's lands](the-knights-lands.md), where they are treated as respected warriors of honor, but some leave the region to look for an adventurous life without the fame and the legends that originate from their childhood.***

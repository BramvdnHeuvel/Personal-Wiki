Taël is the most good of the [Twelve Gods](gods.md). Their true intentions are good and only good, as the strive to have all live in happiness and prosperity.

Taël's works are most present in the effects that most do not consciously think about anymore. Rarely does Taël use visions, thunderstrikes or strange events to change the flow of events. If Taël wants to influence the world, they do so by having harvests happen (un)successfully, by introducing unexpected pregnancies or by warding Their followers from deadly diseases.

Followers of Taël are usually positive-minded, and strive towards a prosper future. Taël has a lot of paladins that actively fight the forces of evil, though most of Their followers are quite peaceful and attempt to make the best out of their lives, so they can enjoy it to the fullest.

## Followers' traits

Most of Taël's followers share the following morals:

**Live and let live.** Everyone with a good heart deserves a happy and fruitful life. Life of all forms is to be respected: hunting is only for survival, not for joy.

**Harmony and joy go together.** It is very important to respect the lives of others. This brings joy to all.

**Evil should be expelled.** Evil is an unwanted disease in the world that should be banished. There should be no mercy for those who are beyond forgiveness and redemption.
